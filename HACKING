NOTES FOR DEVELOPING THESE SCRIPTS

Some repositories on apt-get.org contain architectures surrounded in
single quotes, eg. "'i386'", "''i386''" and "'''i386'''". As far as I
can tell these are only ever duplicates, ie. anything containing "'all'"
will also contain "all", and there never seem to be any packages listed
for these quoted archs. Therefore we filter with the "check_arch"
function to throw away those in quotes.
