BUG FIXING
The apt-get.org screen scraping may need fixing

Launchpad scraping currently misses quite a few PPAs

Add heuristics to guess distro, release, etc.

Add repository maker

WISHLIST
Circumvent apt-file's Contents.gz file to give contents of repository

Apt pinning to prevent malicious repos being added through updates

A complementary GPG packaging tool

Add check to see if repo is working (stop packaging dead repos)

Grab contents data from Packages.gz and Sources.gz
