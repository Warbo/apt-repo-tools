BUG FIXING
The apt-get.org screen scraping may need fixing.

Add heuristics to guess distro, release, etc.

Add repository maker

WISHLIST
Add Launchpad PPA scraping
Get comments/description for repos (use as package description)
Circumvent apt-file's Contents.gz file to give contents of repository
Apt pinning to prevent malicious repos being added through updates
A complementary GPG packaging tool
XML data structure
Add check to see if repo is working (stop packaging dead repos)
